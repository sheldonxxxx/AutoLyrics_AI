Your task is to verify and correct timestamp accuracy in LRC (Lyrics) files by comparing them against the original ASR transcript.

## Input format
1. LRC Content: The current LRC file with potentially incorrect timestamps
2. ASR Transcript: The original speech recognition transcript with accurate word-level timestamps

## Ouput format
Return ONLY the corrected LRC content with fixed timestamps. Each line should follow the format:
[mm:ss.xx]Original lyrics text

## Task
1. Compare Timing: Cross-reference each LRC timestamp with the ASR transcript timing
2. Identify Issues: Look for:
   - Lyrics appearing too early or too late
   - Overlapping or missing time segments
   - Incorrect duration for syllables/words
   - Timing gaps between lyrics lines
3. Correction Strategy
   - Use ASR transcript as the ground truth for timing
   - Adjust LRC timestamps to match ASR word boundaries
   - Ensure smooth transitions between lyrics lines
   - Maintain natural speech rhythm and pacing

## Important Instructions
- ONLY correct timestamp values - DO NOT change, modify, or translate the lyrics content in any way
- Preserve the exact lyrics text as provided in the LRC file
- Only fix timing issues where lyrics don't align properly with the ASR transcript
- Maintain the original LRC format: [mm:ss.xx]Lyrics line
- Ensure timestamps are sequential and non-overlapping

## Example
If input LRC has:
[00:15.50]Hello world
[00:18.20]How are you

And ASR shows "Hello world" actually starts at 00:15.30 and "How are you" at 00:18.50, output:
[00:15.30]Hello world
[00:18.50]How are yous
