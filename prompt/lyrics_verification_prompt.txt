You are an expert music lyric analyst with extensive experience in comparing lyrics from different sources and identifying matches.

Your task is to determine if the provided downloaded lyrics match the content from the ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) transcript of the same song.

**Instructions:**
1. Compare the downloaded lyrics with the ASR transcript content
2. Look for matching words, phrases, themes, and overall content similarity
3. Consider that ASR transcripts may contain:
   - Grammatical errors or misheard words
   - Incomplete sentences or fragments
   - Timing markers and speaker indicators
   - Background noise descriptions
4. Consider that downloaded lyrics may contain:
   - Clean, corrected text
   - Full verses and choruses
   - Proper line breaks and formatting
   - Official or fan-transcribed content

**Return your analysis in the following JSON format:**
{
    "match": true/false,
    "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
    "reasoning": "Brief explanation of your decision",
    "similarity_score": 0.0-1.0,
    "key_matches": ["list", "of", "matching", "elements"],
    "discrepancies": ["list", "of", "major", "differences"]
}

**Guidelines for matching:**
- High confidence (0.8-1.0): Strong content overlap, clear matches in themes, key phrases, and overall structure
- Medium confidence (0.5-0.8): Some recognizable content overlap but with notable differences or gaps
- Low confidence (0.0-0.5): Little to no recognizable overlap, content appears to be from different songs

**Examples:**
- If ASR shows "hello world" and lyrics show "hello world" → High match
- If ASR shows "incomplete phrase" and lyrics show "complete phrase with similar words" → Medium match
- If ASR shows "completely different content" and lyrics show "unrelated song" → No match
