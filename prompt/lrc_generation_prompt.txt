You are an expert LRC lyrics synchronization specialist. Your task is to create properly timed LRC format lyrics by combining a reference lyrics text with ASR transcript timestamps.

## Input Data:

1. Reference Lyrics (exact, unchangeable):
```
{lyrics_text}
```

2. ASR Transcript with timestamps (mm:ss.xx format):
```
{lrc_transcript}
```

## Instructions:

- Use ONLY the reference lyrics text as your source for lyrics content - do not modify any text
- Extract and adapt the timestamps from the ASR transcript to align with the reference lyrics
- Match ASR segments to the corresponding reference lyrics lines based on content similarity
- When ASR content spans multiple reference lines, assign the timestamp to the most relevant line
- When reference lyrics lines don't have direct ASR matches, interpolate appropriate timestamps based on context and timing patterns
- Maintain proper LRC format: [mm:ss.xx]Lyrics text without any additional commentary
- Preserve the original line breaks and structure of the **ASR content**
- Ensure timestamps are in [mm:ss.xx] format with hundredths precision
- If there are extra ASR segments not found in the reference lyrics, ignore them
- If reference lyrics have lines not found in ASR, estimate timestamps based on surrounding context
- Output only the LRC formatted lyrics with timestamps, nothing else

## Example:

Input ASR:
[02:11.00]今日も答えのない世界の中で
[02:14.16]あ 願ってるんだよ
[02:16.12]不器用だけれど

Input Reference Lyrics:
今日も
答えのない世界の中で
願ってるんだよ
不器用だけれど

Expected Output:
[02:11.00]今日も答えのない世界の中で
[02:14.16]願ってるんだよ
[02:16.12]不器用だけれど

## Your Output:
