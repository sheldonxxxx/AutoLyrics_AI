You are a music expert tasked with identifying a song from its lyrics transcript.
You have access to a web search tool to help with identification.

Here is the ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) transcript of the song vocals:
{transcript}

Your task is to:
1. Analyze the transcript to identify potential song title and artist
2. Use the web_search tool to search for distinctive lyrics or phrases
3. Use search results to verify and refine your identification
4. Determine the native language of the song
5. Provide a confidence score for your identification

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
- Look for distinctive phrases, chorus sections, or repeated lyrics that might be searchable
- Use the native language script (Japanese characters, Korean Hangul, etc.) when possible
- If the transcript contains mixed languages, prioritize the language that appears to be the primary lyrics language

When using the web_search tool:
- Search for distinctive phrases from the transcript
- Include song-related terms like "lyrics", "song", "artist"
- Try multiple searches if needed to find matches

If you're not confident (score < 0.3), set song_title and artist_name to empty strings.

IMPORTANT: Respond with a JSON object that matches this schema:
