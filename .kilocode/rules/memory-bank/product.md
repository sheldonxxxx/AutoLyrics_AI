# Product: Music Lyrics Processing Pipeline

## Product Overview

The Music Lyrics Processing Pipeline is a comprehensive Python-based solution for processing music files to extract lyrics, separate vocals, and generate synchronized LRC format lyrics with translation capabilities. The system automates the complex process of creating synchronized lyrics for music files, which is valuable for music players, karaoke applications, and accessibility tools.

## Core Purpose

This product addresses the challenge of creating accurate, time-synchronized lyrics for music files. Traditional approaches to lyric synchronization require manual timing, which is time-consuming and error-prone. Our pipeline automates this process by combining AI technologies to extract vocals, transcribe speech, and align lyrics with audio timing.

## Key Problems Solved

1. **Manual Lyric Timing**: Eliminates the need for manual synchronization of lyrics with music
2. **Lyric Availability**: Automatically searches for and retrieves lyrics from online sources
3. **Audio Processing**: Separates vocals from music tracks to improve transcription accuracy
4. **Multi-language Support**: Provides translation capabilities for international use
5. **Batch Processing**: Handles multiple files in a directory recursively

## How It Works

The system operates through a six-stage pipeline:

1. **Metadata Extraction**: Extracts song title, artist, and other metadata from audio files
2. **Lyrics Search**: Searches for lyrics on uta-net.com using song title and artist
3. **Vocal Separation**: Separates vocals from music using AI-based audio separation
4. **Transcription**: Generates timestamped transcription of vocals using Whisper ASR
5. **LRC Generation**: Combines lyrics and transcription to create synchronized LRC files
6. **Translation**: Translates LRC lyrics to different languages (Traditional Chinese)
